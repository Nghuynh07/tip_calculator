## My process

1. npx create-react-app
2. npm i sass
3. Add folders: SASS/SCSS, components, images
4. Add JSX file to components: 2 main JSX files: Bill.js and Tip.js and Calculator.js as the parent element as container
5. HTML5 markup. This includes add classes using BEM style, group elements together using css box-model
6. Styling using SCSS and add Media queries only when layout breaks
7. Adding logic to the calculator:

   - I started out by ensuring all user's input and click events of the buttons are working correcting as intended by console.log().
   - For the tip % I use dataset attribute and use the synthetic DOM to get the value of the tip then convert into Number() for calculations
   - After that is just a matter of simple calculations and the order of logics

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- SCSS

### What I learned

- I have been on and off with react; however, this project I reviewed a lot on the useState and the useEffect hook.
- I learned about onFocus onBlur and use it to change the border of the container.
- The logic of calculator itself requires a little of thinking and logic but I was able to figure out.

### Continued development

- As I progress through the project, sending data using props become tedious. Refractor into contextAPI can be a better solution. Can also build custom hooks for reusable code as well
